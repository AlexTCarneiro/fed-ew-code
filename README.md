### Create starter-theme.php
This code is:
- A simple structure to use as a starting point for building a custom WordPress theme, including style and script enqueuing, support for featured images, custom navigation menus, a custom post type (Portfolio), a custom widget area, and additional functionalities.
- Then I customize after, adding whatever is necessary, depending on the project specs, like CSS Animations, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, React, Vue, CSS/SCSS, etc...
- Sometimes I also use this _Bootstrap Starter Theme generator for WordPress_: https://them.es/starter-bootstrap/
- This gives me a boilerplate to start building the customer's look and feel requested in the project.

### Create latest-3-posts.php

This code is:
- A simple PHP code snippet related to front-end development in WordPress.

- In a scenario where I'm customizing a WordPress theme and want to display the latest three posts in a specific category on the front end.

This snippet is: 
- enqueuing Vue.js, 
- a custom JavaScript file (custom-scripts.js ?), and,
- creating a shortcode ([vuepress]) that will embed a Vue.js component into a WordPress page or post.
- Usually I replace https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.14 with the correct CDN link for the Vue.js version I need/want to use and
- Then customize the Vue component according to the project needs...
